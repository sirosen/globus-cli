*--deadline*::

Set a deadline in ISO time format for this to be canceled if not completed by.
ISO format is 'YYYY-MM-DD' or 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' If hours minutes and
seconds are not given they are assumed to be 00:00:00. This time must not
be in the past or the task will not be submitted.

*--dry-run*::

Don't submit the task, but print submission data instead.

*--label*::

Set an optional label for the task. These are meant for human readability and
ease of filtering the task list

*--submission-id*::

Specify a submission id to use with this task. Submission id's are generated
using 'globus task generate-submission-id' and prevent re-submission of
a task with the same submission id in case of unreliable networks.
Note that this is not the same id as the task's id once it is submitted.
If not specified the Globus CLI will still generate a submission id and safely
resubmit tasks on network errors.
