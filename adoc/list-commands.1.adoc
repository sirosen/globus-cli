= LIST-COMMANDS(1)

== NAME

globus list-commands - List all commands available in the globus cli

== SYNOPSIS

*globus list-commands*

== DESCRIPTION

The *list-commands* command prints the name and a short description of
every command available in the globus cli. Commands are grouped by their
parent commands, e.g. 'activate' is listed under 'globus endpoint' and is
invoked with 'globus endpoint activate'.

Note that commands with the same name but different parent commands are
distinct. e.g. 'globus task update' is a distinct command from
'globus endpoint update'.
