path is given, the default directory on that endpoint will be used.

== OPTIONS

*-a, --all*::

Show hidden files and directories that start with '.'

*-l, --long*::

Long form tabular output similar to 'ls -l'.

*-r, --recursive*::

Do a recursive listing similar to 'ls -R' only goes as deep as allowed by
the --recursive-depth-limit. Note that this can quickly become a very expensive
operation and may take a significant amount of time to complete or even fail on
rate limits.

*--recursive-depth-limit*::

Set the depth limit when using the --recursive option. Defaults to 3 if not
given.
