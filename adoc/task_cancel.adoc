= GLOBUS TASK CANCEL(1)

== NAME

globus task cancel - Cancel a Task owned by the current user

== SYNOPSIS

*globus task cancel* ['OPTIONS'] 'TASK_ID'

*globus task cancel* *--all* ['OPTIONS']


== DESCRIPTION

The *globus task cancel* command cancels a specific task which you own or all
tasks which you own. This includes not only currently executing tasks, but also
any queued tasks which you may have which have not started execution.

You must either provide the *--all* option or a 'TASK_ID'.

== OPTIONS

*-a/--all*::

When given, 'TASK_ID' is not required. Cancel all pending and executing tasks.

== OUTPUT

Output depends on whether or not *--all* was provided, and of course on the
requested output format.
If *--all* is requested, output will contain all task IDs which were
cancelled. If, in addition to this, the output format is text, the results will
be streamed as tasks are cancelled. JSON output is buffered and printed all at
once, after all of the cancellations.

When *--all* is not passed, output is a simple success message indicating that
the task was cancelled, or an error.


== EXAMPLES
