== NAME

globus task generate-submission-id - Generate a new Task submission ID


== SYNOPSIS

*globus task generate-submission-id* ['OPTIONS']


== DESCRIPTION

The *globus task generate-submission-id* command generates a new Task submission
ID for use in *globus transfer* and *globus delete*.

Submission IDs allow you to safely retry submission of a Task in the presence of
network errors. No matter how many times you submit a Task with a given ID, it
will only be accepted and executed once. The response status may change between
submissions.

----
$ sub_id="$(globus task generate-submission-id)"
$ globus transfer --submission-id "$sub_id" ...
----
