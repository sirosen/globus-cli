tasks displayed may be filtered by a number of attributes, each with a separate
commandline option.

Limit the number of results to the 'N' most recent. Default value is 10.

multiple times, meaning any non-matching patterns are excluded.

matches. When *--inexact* is given, these patterns may include '*' as a
wild-card, and may ignore case.
