= GLOBUS TASK WAIT(1)

== NAME

globus task wait - Wait for a Task to complete

== SYNOPSIS

*globus task wait* ['OPTIONS'] 'TASK_ID'

*globus task wait* *--timeout* 'N' *--polling-interval* 'M' *--heartbeat* ['OPTIONS'] 'TASK_ID'


== DESCRIPTION

The *globus task wait* command polls a task to see if it has completed. It
waits until the timeout is reached, checking every *M* seconds (where *M* is
the polling interval).

If the task succeeds by then, it exits with status 0. Otherwise, it exits with
status 1.

== OPTIONS

*--timeout* 'N'::

Wait a maximum of 'N' seconds. If omitted, *globus task wait* will wait
indefinitely, until the task succeeds or fails.

*--polling-interval* 'M'::

Check task status (and potentially hearbeat) every 'M' seconds. Defaults to 1.

*-H/--heartbeat*::

Turn on heartbeats. When set, a '.' character will be printed to standard error
every polling interval.

== EXAMPLES

Wait 30 seconds for a task to complete, printing heartbeats to stderr and
producing a JSON description of the task at the end:

----
$ globus task wait --timeout 30 -H --format json TASK_ID
----

Wait for a task without limit, silently, polling every 5 minutes:

----
$ globus task wait --polling-interval 300 TASK_ID
----
